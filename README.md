# LifeBalance

**LifeBalance** is a chaotic, physics-based strategy mobile game about balancing life’s responsibilities (literally).

Help our hero juggle **work, family, hobbies, and self-care** on a wobbly board, one plan at a time.  
Drop too many items? **Game over.** Keep everything stable? **New high score - and you’re winning at life.**

> **Vibe:** *Tetris meets self-care* with the gentle chaos of *Tricky Towers*.

## 🎮 Game Concept
A fast, satisfying balancing challenge where every object represents a tiny piece of everyday life - stack it, steady it, and survive the wobble.

## 🧠 Core Mechanics
- **Drag & Drop Physics**  
  Pull items from your inventory - work laptops, face masks, yoga mats, bath ducks, and more.
- **Balance the Board**  
  Place objects strategically using realistic physics and weight distribution.
- **Don’t Drop Too Much**  
  A few drops are forgiven… but too many and it’s over.
- **Score Chasing**  
  Earn points as you stack higher and keep your setup stable. Beat your **personal high score**.

## ✨ What Makes Us Different?
- **Relatable Theme**  
  Not saving the world - just surviving Tuesdays. Every item tells a micro-story players recognize.
- **Cozy *and* Chaotic**  
  Warm visuals + wobbly physics + an addictive soundtrack = stress relief… and stress.
- **One-Handed Gameplay**  
  Designed for commutes, waiting rooms, and coffee breaks. Runs last **2–5 minutes**, but feel complete.
- **Optionally Competitive**  
  Play to beat yourself, or compete with others - best of both worlds.
